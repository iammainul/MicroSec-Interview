# MicroSec-Interview
These are programs which I have done. 
I used a virtual box host adapter to implement the second one giving the client and the server differnt ip address and using the python script as forwarder. 

The network sniffer sniffs to the public network. 

Instructions: 
For the Server Client architechture: 
Install Virtual Box
Create a host based network
Change the IP in the Python script.
cahnge the port address in the Clinet.c

For the bash files:
chmod +x filename.sh
./filename.sh {argument1} {argument2}
